## The Concept

Think of this as a virtual engineering company:

- **Orchestrator** = CTO / VP Engineering — understands the intent of any request, knows which team(s) to pull in, coordinates across teams
- **Master Skills** = Team Leads — broad domain knowledge, delegates to specialists
- **Sub-Skills** = Specialists — deep expertise in one area, does the actual work

## SDLC Phase Coverage

| Phase | Team Responsible | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 0. Research & Discovery | Research Analyst | NEW |
| 1. Requirements & Planning | Project Planner | NEW |
| 2. Design & Architecture | System Architect, Frontend Architect, Backend Architect | PARTIAL |
| 3. Development | Frontend, Backend, Database, Mobile, AI/ML | PARTIAL |
| 4. Testing & QA | QA Engineer | NEW |
| 5. Build, Deploy & Release | DevOps Engineer | NEW |
| 6. Operations & Monitoring | SRE Engineer | NEW |
| 7. Maintenance & Optimization | SRE + Security + relevant dev team | NEW |
| Cross-cutting: Security | Security Engineer | NEW |
| Cross-cutting: Documentation | Technical Writer | NEW |
| Cross-cutting: Code Quality | Code Reviewer | NEW |

---

## Master Skill #0: Orchestrator

**Folder:** `orchestrator/`

The top-level agent. It does NOT do work itself — it understands user intent and routes to the correct team(s). It can bring in multiple teams for cross-cutting tasks.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse user intent (Are they asking for research? Architecture? A bug fix? A deployment?)
- Route to the correct master skill (or multiple skills for complex requests)
- Coordinate handoffs between teams (e.g., architect designs → developer implements → QA tests)
- Track project context across sessions

**Sub-skills:** None — this is the coordinator, not a specialist.

## How Each Session Should Work

For each session creating a new skill:

1. **Research Phase**: Use web search to gather the latest best practices, tools, frameworks, and patterns for that domain (2026-current).
2. **SKILL.md Creation**: Write the master skill file — this is the "team lead" with broad domain knowledge, decision frameworks, and guidance on when to consult which sub-skill.
3. **Sub-skill References**: Create each sub-skill reference file with deep, actionable knowledge — not generic overviews, but production-proven patterns, specific tool recommendations, and decision matrices.
4. **Cross-references**: Add references to related skills (e.g., `security-engineer` should reference `devops-engineer` for infra security, `backend-architect` for app security).
5. **Evals (where applicable)**: Create evaluation scenarios to test the skill's quality.

## Design Principles for All Skills

1. **Conversational first** — Skills ask questions before giving answers. No prescriptive dumps.
2. **Tradeoff-oriented** — Always present 2-3 options with pros/cons. Let the user decide.
3. **Production-proven** — Reference real-world implementations, not textbook theory.
4. **Current** — Always use WebSearch to verify advice. Ecosystems change fast.
5. **Cross-referencing** — Skills should know their boundaries and defer to other skills when appropriate.
6. **Scale-aware** — Different advice for a 3-person startup vs a 200-person enterprise.
